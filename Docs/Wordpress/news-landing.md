# News Landing

News is a custom post type set up in ACF. It has an option page, this page is used to create the styles for `/news`.

Goto **News** -> **News Landing**.

They're 2 tabs. Content and Page styles.

In Page content, click **page builder** and select **Add Post**. This is the only require item here, you could use the page builder to design a fancy archive landing page.

Leave content blank, as this is ignored when it's added to an archive page, it will use the loop.

Add a pagination Title i.e. **Pagination**.

The styles tab allows you to style this component.

Page styles, this will allow you to style the page that contains the components.

See **ACF** -> **News Landing** for fields.

See: `src/js/components/add-posts/components-add-posts.php`
