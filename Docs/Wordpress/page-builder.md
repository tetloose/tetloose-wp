# Page Builder

This is a user friendly name given to the components.

The page builder exisits on every page / post, allows you build custom pages / posts using the avalible components using ACF Flexible Content.

On first sync of ACF, you will have access to every component ever built for Tetloose-WP, but they don't actually exist in `src/js/components` only the core ones.

1. add-posts
2. archive
3. excerpt
4. footer
5. functions
6. header
7. menu
8. navigation
9. pages
10. partials
11. post-nav
12. social
13. wrapper

To add these missing components, use `yarn add-component` to add them from the component library.

Once you have all the desired components, you will need to go into **ACF** -> **Shared Fields**, to the bottom, expand **components**. Then delete the components i.e **Animated Banner**, **Hero** etc.

The idea to make every page editable even posts which allows the user to create a completly custom end product.

The Plugin **Easy Post Duplicator** is perfect, you can design your pages and posts, then duplicate them and only alter the content if you wanna keep a theme going.
