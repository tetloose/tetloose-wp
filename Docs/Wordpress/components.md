# Components

Tetloose-WP relies on ACF Flexible Content to build page layouts.

## Flexible Content

See **ACF** -> **Shared Fields** -> **Components**

This is a list of available components, the names should match the directory in `src/js/components` or be kind of similar so you know what they are.

You can add remove Components here. Once you've created your fields, click **Save Changes**. You can then select this new component using the page builder button on pages and posts.

See [DEVELOPMENT COMPONENTS](../Development/components.md) for component creation.
