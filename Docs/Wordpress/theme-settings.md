# Theme Settings

Click the tab at the top, **Theme Settings**.

The first tab **Global Styles**, this is where you define **Font's** and **Colors**. Some default values are already available in the fields, press **Update**. You will see the colors update in the above message.

Header, Footer and Social, are custom fields for The current Header and Footer component. If you were to create a new component you would need to probably alter these options to match the layout.

The Tab **Styles**, these have the styles for Header / Footer / Social. There is also an option to add the default select color, when you highlight text. Again these would change depending on the project requirement.

The options for these are in **ACF** -> **Settings**.

The final Tab **Scripts**, this is an entry point into the projects Head, Body and Footer. You can add any thing custom here. Some project require Google Analytics, instead of altering code, just paste it here and let Wordpress do it for you.

See component files:

- `src/js/components/wrapper`
- `src/js/components/header/header-component.php`
- `src/js/components/footer/footer-component.php`
