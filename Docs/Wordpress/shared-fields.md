# Shared fields

ACF can get a bit out of control when you have lots of pages and posts all using different fields and most of the time they are duplicated.

The clone field is a great way to get around this. There is a custom page type called Shared Fields, this is used as a blank page, so we can assign fields to it that never get shown on the backend.

We can then clone these hidden fields into all the other fields.

See **ACF** -> **Shared Fields**.

This contains every field type the project would require.

Once these are set up, you can then clone them. With option pages and archive pages you can prefix the variable.

This is a great way to make ACF Dry.
