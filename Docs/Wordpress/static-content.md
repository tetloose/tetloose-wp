# Static Content

The idea is to content manage every part of a project, this alleviates the need to make code changes.

Click the tab at the top, **Static Content**.

You have 4 tabs, 404 page, No posts, Password Protected and each of their styles.

Update this content and hit **Update**.

If other elements in the project are outside of a component, then add them here.

See **ACF** -> **Static Content**.

See component files:

- `src/js/components/pages/page-404.php`
- `src/js/components/pages/page-no-posts.php`
- `src/js/components/pages/page-password.php`
