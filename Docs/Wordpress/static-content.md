# Static Content

The idea is to content manage every part of a project, this alleviate the need to make code changes when it's content related.

Goto **Static Content**.

You have 4 tabs, 404 page, No posts, Password Protected and each of their styles.

Update this content and hit **Update**.

If other elements in the project are outside of a component, then add them here.

See **ACF** -> **Static Content**.
