# Static Content

The idea is to content manage every part of a project, this alleviates the need to make code changes.

Click the tab at the top, **Static Content**. This will give you several sub menu's.

- No Posts
- Password Protected
- 404

These are static pages that are content managed outside the Wordpress loop.

Each component has it's own fields and styles.

Update their content and press **Update**.

If other elements in the project are outside of a component, then add them here.

## ACF Fields

- **ACF** -> **no-posts**
- **ACF** -> **password-protected**
- **ACF** -> **404**

See component files:

- `src/js/components/pages/page-no-posts.php`
- `src/js/components/pages/page-password.php`
- `src/js/components/pages/page-404.php`
