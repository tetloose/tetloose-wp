# Pattern Library

`yarn add-component`

This will list all available components in the library that can be added to the project. Copy the component name from the list, paste it into the command line and it will be added to `src/js/components`.

For more info about the pattern library see [Pattern Library Docs](https://github.com/tetloose/tetloose-wp-pattern-library/blob/main/README.md).
